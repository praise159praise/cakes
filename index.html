      The staff, chef, and servers for Priscas Cakes are great to work with.They helped me pick out my menu and arranged all changes I decided to make as the big day approached.   The food was wonderful. Many guests let me know how much they enjoyed the meal. (I highly recommend the stuffed chicken.)   The wait staff were professional, nice, and fun. One of the bartenders even helped teach the Father of the Bride how to dance The Wobble! It was such a fun reception and that was made possible by PrisCas Cakes

      Great wedding ! Even better food!”…the review from my MOH. : ) PrisCas Cakes impressed me from the beginning. I highly recommend Priscas Cakes. They worked within our budget and the food, service and presentation were top notch. Jen was wonderful to work with while planning the menu and layout and the moment I met Steven (our on-site manager) I knew everything would run smoothly the day of – and they still exceeded my expectations. Every server at the reception was friendly and professional and so attentive. I cannot tell you what a relief it was as a bride to never worry about the catering – everything was perfect.

      Food was great at my wedding. Everyone raved about the salmon!  Priscas Cakes makes WONDERFUL food. I got SO many compliments on the food at my wedding and I sure liked it too! They were able to make exactly what I wanted and were especially helpful taking care of serving our signature cocktails when we provided the ingredients. They were very easy to work with and had great staff. I think the value is also wonderful and they can do a wide range of food prices

      I have worked with Priscas Cakes both personally (for our wedding rehearsal dinner) and professionally at work. Each time they go above and beyond with service and quality. Our rehearsal dinner menu was DELICIOUS and they were even able to bar-tend for us which was an added bonus. Their staff is easy to work with and helped our event to run smoothly.

      The food we had at our wedding was incredible! I have had food from PrisCas Cakes at multiple events and it never lets me down! The staff and servers were meticulous in making sure my husband and I had everything we needed. It doesn’t get any better!
